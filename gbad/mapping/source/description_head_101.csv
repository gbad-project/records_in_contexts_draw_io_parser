Lennox, detailing many projects in the Toronto area, and a few outside of the city. It also contains a small amount of textual material pertaining to his professional career, and publications.  Toronto area buildings represented in the holdings by architectural plans include the Parliament Buildings, Old City Hall, the King Edward Hotel, the Toronto Western Hospital, the Toronto Hospital for Incurables, the Excelsior Life Assurance Co. at 59 Victoria Street and 20 Toronto St., the Toronto Electric Light Co. warehouse and office building on Lake St., the Russell Motor Car Company factory and office building on Weston Rd., the Dominion Radiator Co. Foundry at Queen and Dufferin Sts., the Toronto Foundry Co. foundry on Liberty St., various St. Paul's Church buildings and Casa Loma.  Buildings outside Toronto include: the Powerhouse for the Electrical Development Company and the Toronto and Niagara Power Company Substation, both in Niagara Falls; a warehouse in Winnipeg, Manitoba; and a boat house and hotel in Muskoka.  Full drawing suites for many of the projects have not survived in the fonds.  Some series contain only fragmentary working drawings or depictions of design elements from a certain period of the work.  Textual materials relating to Lennox's work consist primarily of specifications for his building projects outlining the agreed statements of requirement with respect to materials to be provided and labour to be performed. They detail all materials to be used in construction including elements such as plumbing, wiring, etc. They also detail the required plastering, painting, masonry, carpentry, glazing, and steelworking that need to be done. Buildings for which specifications exist include St. Paul's Church on Bloor St. E., the Hospital for Incurables on Dunn St., Postal Station ""G"", the E.J. Lennox residence at the corner of Walmer and Davenport Roads, the west wing of the Ontario Parliament Buildings, 10-20 Waterloo Avenue, the Maurice Cody Memorial Hall of St. Paul's Church, Municipal and county buildings for the City of Toronto and the County of York, in addition to the Excelsior Life Insurance Company, and the Western Hospital.  Lennox's office had a practice of annotating and altering previous specifications for new projects having similar construction.  This production of two records within one document is apparent by the alteration of the date.  It is often not certain which alterations are for what project, and whether the earlier original or later alteration is the final copy.  A better copy of the former may be in the specifications for a later project.  Specifications also have wrappers with names of local contractors, building materials manufacturers and suppliers.  Other textual records include a small amount of correspondence and reports pertaining to the Lennox family's involvement in the Eastern Manitoba Lands Corporation and the Otter Lake Mining Syndicate, (1905-1937); tenders, receipts and invoices for a few projects that were sent to E.J. Lennox & Son Architects between 1925 and 1935; and Lennox's drawings registers and a cash book (1889-1924).

He loaned the drawings to the Archives of Ontario in 1967. When Mr. Petrozzi died, ownership of the records passed to his wife. These records were then purchased by the Ontario Heritage Foundation on behalf of the Archives of Ontario. In 1987 the Ontario Heritage Foundation passed ownership of the drawings to the Archives of Ontario.  The textual records in this fonds were originally in the custody of E. J. Lennox's granddaughter Mrs. Mary Gooderham. However, they were collected into a group by Alice Alison who deposited them with the Municipal Reference Library in Toronto over several years. Mrs. Alison was an architectural student researching E.J. Lennox. The records fell into the custody of the organization ""Friends of the Old City Hall"", whose purpose was to prevent the proposed destruction of the Old City Hall in the early 1970s. In 1975 the fonds was placed in the custody of the City of Toronto Archives while a decision was made as to where they should ultimately reside.

61,C 130,Fonds,Marsden Kemp fonds,[ca. 1898-ca. 1930],,"896 photographs : glass negatives,  nitrate negatives, glass lantern slides, and prints ; black and white",,"Fonds consists of black and white photographs that document Eastern Ontario communities, recreation, steamships, people and events in the early 20th century. The photographs are primarily glass plate negatives although nitrate negatives, glass lantern slides and prints are also included.  The photographs are the output of Kemp's amateur passion for photography; he was known to travel Eastern Ontario by bicycle capturing images from that era on photograph. The fonds consists of images primarily from Picton and Kingston as well as a number of portraits of Kemp, his family, and likely others with whom he associated although the nature of those associations or relationships has not been identified.  Whatever original order existed in this fonds has been lost. Sequential numbers were assigned to the negatives by George Miller, the antique dealer who found the negatives, but no rationale for this arrangement appears evident other than perhaps the order in which the photographs were found or described by Mr. Miller. Since the bulk of the photographs are undated a chronological arrangement could not be adopted. Instead, the photographs have been arranged into six series based upon subject matter.  The prints in this fonds were produced ca.1968 and have been included in the series descriptions only when they are the sole surviving images (i.e. the original negatives are not extant)",Access to the original glass plate negatives will only be permitted where a print is not available and provided that the negatives are not closed for conservation reasons.,"Records are in the public domain.

Miller found about 4,000 to 5,000 negatives and managed to salvage almost 1,000 of them as the passage of time and the storage conditions had taken their toll on most of the negatives.   He also had prints made from many of the negatives. Mr. Miller numbered and compiled descriptions of these negatives in a notebook. The source of his information for these descriptions is unclear since relatively few of the glass plate negatives have inscriptions. Miller's notebook reveals possible contacts who knew Marsden Kemp and who, in turn, may have provided some of the identifications. Alternatively, there may have been some documentation, such as the original enclosures, which provided this information. In any case, the content of a large number of the photographs remained unidentified. In 1968 the Archives of Ontario acquired 64 copy prints of the negatives from Mr. Miller and in 1970 acquired the original glass negatives from Thomas Bouckley of Oshawa. One single copy print was donated from another source in 1967, although it was not identified as a Marsden Kemp photograph at the time of donation.",,,Some of the photographs from this fonds are available in digital format in the Archives of Ontario Visual Database.

As an essential tool, the Fire insurance plans were employed by insurance companies to monitor both the physical composition of urban centres and the spatial distribution of policy-holders as too great a concentration of policy-holders in an area could lead to significant losses on the part of insurance companies in the event of fire. The information captured on the plans (including building size, interior and exterior construction, street widths, fire protection facilities, property lines, and occupancy) was used to calculate insurance risks and set rates. Earlier manuscript plans were prepared on an ad hoc basis for a number of Canadian communities as early as 1808. The insurance companies however, were not at first convinced, of the value of using fire insurance plans to calculate risks and rates.  The systematic production of printed fire insurance plans in Canada dates back to 1875-76 when Charles (Chas.) E. Goad began his mapping operations. Trained as a civil engineer, Goad's most significant accomplishment was his series of fire insurance plans of urban centres, both in and outside Canada, which were compiled and published by the company he founded at Montreal in 1875. By the time of Goad's death in 1910, his company had produced plans for over 1300 Canadian communities, as well as plans for numerous foreign cities, special surveys of individual properties, a series of conflagration maps, and ""general utility"" atlases for Toronto and Montreal.    The Ontario communities represented in the collection include major cities like Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton, Kingston and London, often arranged into multi-volumes, and cities or towns in more remote areas of the province such as Ingersoll, Campbellford, and Elliot Lake. Some plans are of larger areas encompassing more than one municipality, for example, a plan that shows Cambridge, Galt and Preston.
