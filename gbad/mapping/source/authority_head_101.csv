The Executive Council, along with the Lieutenant Governor, also performed a judicial role by acting as a Court of Appeal.","Although the structure and responsibilities of the Executive Council were not defined by the Constitutional Act of 1791, it was understood that such a body would exist as part of the English governmental system being established in the new Province of Upper Canada. Members of the Executive Council were generally appointed by the Crown - on the recommendation of the Lieutenant Governor - or by the Lieutenant Governor himself. Most were also members of the Legislative Council (of the thirty-six appointments to the Executive Council between 1791 and 1841, twenty-four were members of the Legislative Council). However, being a member of the Legislative Council was not a pre-requisite for appointment. The Executive Council of Upper Canada was not responsible to the Legislative Assembly (unlike the current Executive Council of the Province of Ontario), rather it was simply an advisory body to the Lieutenant Governor. In the absence of the Lieutenant Governor, the administrator of the province was chosen from among the senior members of the Council. Three members of the Council together constituted a quorum. With the union of Upper and Lower Canada in 1841, the Executive Council of Upper Canada was dissolved, and replaced by the Executive Council of the Province of Canada.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Armstrong, Frederick.

3796,AA99,Ontario. Treasury Board (1886-1971),,,The Treasury Board of Cabinet was responsible for reviewing government expenditures and ensuring effective use of public money.,"The Treasury Board was originally established in 1886 as a Committee of the Executive Council. The provincial Treasurer served as the chair of the committee. During the period prior to 1950, the Board had little power, met infrequently and had no permanent staff. Its primary role during this period was to review and approve Special Warrants and Treasury Board Orders to meet shortfalls in departmental estimates. The development of the government in the wake of the depression and war, however, quickly overwhelmed the ability of the existing system to deal with demands on government revenues. A private firm of auditors, Woods, Gordon and Company, recommended a complete revision of the act and the functions of the Treasury Board to deal with the new situation. This revision took the form of the ""Financial Administration Act"" of 1954, which stipulated that the Board would consist of the Treasurer as Chair, along with four to seven members of the Executive Council, and that this body would serve as the Committee of the Executive Council on all matters relating to finance, revenues, estimates, expenditures and any other matter concerning general administrative policy of the Government of Ontario. The Board was also given the power to call witnesses and compel the production of documents from the public service relating to financial administration and to make regulations relating to the administration of public money and the efficient administration of the public service. In 1962, a permanent Treasury Board Secretariat was established in order to provide advice and analysis to the Treasury Board on government programs and expenditures. In 1971, the Treasury Board was renamed the Management Board of Cabinet with expanded responsibilities for personnel management.",,,,,,,,,,,,"MacTaggart, Hazel.
