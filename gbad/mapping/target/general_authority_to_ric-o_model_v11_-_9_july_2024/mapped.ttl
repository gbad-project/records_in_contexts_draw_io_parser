  rico:history "CHIN is composed of television facilities and radio stations. CHIN Radio/Television International was incorporated in 1964. The organization was established in 1965, by Johnny Lombardi, and began broadcasting in 1966. Lombardi explained the meaning of CHIN: \"C is for Canada, H for happiness, I and N for international. CHIN is the first multicultural / multilingual station to be established in Ontario. In 1967, CHIN obtained an FM radio license and inherited with that two radio stations, AM 1540 and FM 100.7, as well as a television program on CITY-TV hosted by Johnny Lombardi. In 1967, the first CHIN Picnic was held and has become one of Toronto's most popular annual multicultural events. When Lombardi died in 2002, ownership of CHIN Radio/TV International passed to his son Lenny and daughters Theresa and Donina. CHIN Ottawa CJLL 97.9FM began broadcasting to the Ottawa / Gatineau region in October of 2003, and is the first third language radio service in Ottawa.";

  rico:history "Multilingual Television Limited was founded in Toronto in 1979 by Dan Iannuzzi with the backing of private investors Jerry Grafstein, Raymond Moriyama, Steve Stavro, Garth Drabinsky and Nat Taylor. It first aired on Sept. 3, 1979. Popularly known by the call letters CFMT (\"Canada's First Multilingual Television\"), its mandate is to produce and broadcast ethnic programming reflecting a diverse multicultural viewing public, to match third language programming with the needs of each ethnic group, and to entertain and inform members of the ethnic communities in Toronto. The major groups targeted are Italian, Chinese and Portuguese, although the station broadcasts in a total of fifteen different languages. In 1986 Rogers Communications became the major shareholder of CFMT. It became known as \"OMNI1\" in 2002 after Rogers introduced Omni Television, its multilingual programming brand.";

  rico:history "The position of Minister Responsible for Native Affairs was first appointed in June  1985, and assumed duties that had been with the Provincial Secretariat for Resources Development since 1981. The Provincial Secretariat had a \"Native Affairs Policy\" section, which was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Minister Responsible for Native Affairs. When the Ontario Native Affairs Directorate  (known later as a Secretariat) was formed in 1987, it reported to the Legislature through the Minister Responsible for Native Affairs and replaced the \"Native Affairs Policy\" section. The position of Minister Responsible for Native Affairs has been held by Ian G. Scott (1985-1990, also the Attorney General); C. J. Wildman (1990-1995, also the Minister of Natural Resources) and Charles A. Harnick (1995 - , also the Attorney General).";
