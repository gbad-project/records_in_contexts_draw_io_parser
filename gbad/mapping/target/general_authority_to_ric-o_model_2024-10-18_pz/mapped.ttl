  rico:history "CHIN is composed of television facilities and radio stations. CHIN Radio/Television International was incorporated in 1964. The organization was established in 1965, by Johnny Lombardi, and began broadcasting in 1966. Lombardi explained the meaning of CHIN: \"C is for Canada, H for happiness, I and N for international. CHIN is the first multicultural / multilingual station to be established in Ontario. In 1967, CHIN obtained an FM radio license and inherited with that two radio stations, AM 1540 and FM 100.7, as well as a television program on CITY-TV hosted by Johnny Lombardi. In 1967, the first CHIN Picnic was held and has become one of Toronto's most popular annual multicultural events. When Lombardi died in 2002, ownership of CHIN Radio/TV International passed to his son Lenny and daughters Theresa and Donina. CHIN Ottawa CJLL 97.9FM began broadcasting to the Ottawa / Gatineau region in October of 2003, and is the first third language radio service in Ottawa.";

  rico:history "The Department of Finance for the Province of Canada, was established in 1859, replacing the Office of the Inspector General. The title of Inspector General was also changed at this time to that of Minister of Finance. The earlier titles of Inspector General and Inspector General's Office, however, were still often used after 1859. The Department consisted of the Minister of Finance, the Deputy Inspector General, the Audit Branch, and the Customs Branch, headed by the Commissioner of Customs. The Department was responsible for presenting several types of reports to the Legislative Assembly, including an annual report on the public accounts and an annual report on estimates of the expenses of the Executive Council. With Confederation in 1867, the Department of Finance for the Province of Canada was disbanded, and responsibility for the management of the financial affairs of the new Province of Ontario was passed to the Treasury Department.";

  rico:history "On June 9, 1846, legislation was passed which abolished the Board of Works of the Province of Canada and in its place, required the appointment of a chief commissioner and assistant commissioner to administer the construction and management of public works in the province. Although the Act did not specifically designate the office of the commissioners as a department, that is how the commissioners refer to it in their first annual report. In 1859, an \"Act to amend and consolidate the several Acts respecting the Public Works\" was passed, which saw the establishment of a single commissioner of public works, as well as the formal titling of the office as the Department of Public Works. The Department existed until 1867 when the British North America Act was passed. After this time, responsibility for public works in the new Province of Ontario was taken over by the Department of Public Works for Ontario, administered by the Commissioner of Agriculture and Public Works.";

It first aired on Sept. 3, 1979. Popularly known by the call letters CFMT (\"Canada's First Multilingual Television\"), its mandate is to produce and broadcast ethnic programming reflecting a diverse multicultural viewing public, to match third language programming with the needs of each ethnic group, and to entertain and inform members of the ethnic communities in Toronto. The major groups targeted are Italian, Chinese and Portuguese, although the station broadcasts in a total of fifteen different languages. In 1986 Rogers Communications became the major shareholder of CFMT. It became known as \"OMNI1\" in 2002 after Rogers introduced Omni Television, its multilingual programming brand.";

Although the primary responsibility of the Department was the sale and management of public lands and the granting of land to settlers, it was also responsible for the mines, woods and forests of the province. In 1891, a Bureau of Mines, under a director, was established and attached to the Department. By 1895, a Bureau of Forestry, under the direction of the Clerk of Forestry (formerly responsible to the Commissioner of Agriculture and Arts), was also created and attached to the Department of Crown Lands. Immigration also came under the authority of the Department of Crown Lands in 1900, when the Bureau of Colonization was established. In 1905, legislation was passed which renamed the Commissioner of Crown Lands, the Minister of Lands and Mines. With this change, the Department of Crown Lands was also renamed the Department of Lands and Mines.";

The Department was presided over by the Minister of Financial and Commercial Affairs, who was assisted by a Deputy Minister. At the time of its establishment, the Department consisted of the Minister's Office, the Deputy Minister's Office, an Administrative Services Branch, the Registration and Examination Branch, the Office of the Superintendent of Insurance, and the Ontario Securities Commission. In 1967, a Consumer Protection Division was established to be responsible for a newly created Consumer Protection Bureau. The Registration and Examination Branch was also transferred to the Division at this time. Several other branches were created within, or transferred to, this Division in 1968, including the Credit Unions Branch, the Upholstered and Stuffed Articles Branch, and the Cemeteries Branch. Further changes within the Department occurred in 1970, with the creation of a Lotteries Branch and the Companies Branch. The Commercial Registration Appeals Tribunal was also established at this time. In 1972, the Government of Ontario was considerably re-organized as the various Departments were restructured and renamed as Ministries. With this change, the Department of Financial and Commercial Affairs was replaced with the Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations.";

In 1930, the Hospitals Branch of the Department of the Provincial Secretary - responsible for administering Ontario's psychiatric hospitals and inspecting the province's public and private hospitals - was transferred to the Department of Health. In 1952, cancer research and the operation of cancer clinics was added to the Department's responsibilities. At the same time, other functions have been shifted out of the Ministry to other agencies. In 1956,  the Public and Private Hospitals Division was transferred to the Ontario Hospitals Services Commission (although this Commission still reported to the Minister of Health). The water and sewage functions of the old Sanitary Engineering Division were moved to the Ontario Water Resources Commission in 1957. The Ministry of Community and Social Services took responsibility for mental retardation facilities and children's services in 1974, and the Ministry of Labour took charge of the occupational health function in 1976. The Department was organised primarily by divisions until 1959, when they became known as branches. In 1962 a Royal Commission on Health Services was appointed which served as a catalyst for a major overhaul of the Department. This occurred in 1966 when the various branches and programmes of the Department were organized into divisions once again. These divisions included the Public Health Division, Mental Health Division, Medical Services Insurance Division, and the Financial and Administrative Services Division. The Department of Health was replaced by the new Ministry of Health in 1972.";

Between 1937 and 1957, the Department consisted of six different branches. These included the Engineering Branch, the Services Branch, the Finance Branch, the Personnel Branch, the Public Relations Branch, and the Motor Vehicles Branch. On July 1, 1957, legislation was passed which established the Department of Transport, and the Motor Vehicles Branch was transferred to this new Department.

The Department existed for only three years and was abolished in April, 1972. At that time a number of functions were removed from the Department of Justice and continued by the newly established Ministry of the Solicitor General. These included responsibility over the Ontario Provincial Police, the Ontario Fire Commission, the Fire Marshall's Branch, the Centre of Forensic Science, the Supervising Coroner's Branch and the Emergency Measures Branch. Authority over probation and parole matters was also removed in 1972 and given to the new Ministry of Correctional Services.

  rico:history "The Department of Labour was established in 1919, replacing the Trades and Labour Branch of the Department of Public Works. During its existence, the Department had responsibility for a number of different branches, agencies and boards. Although these agencies changed often over the history of the department, they generally focused on five primary areas: the regulation of wages; the regulation of working conditions and the safety of workers; human rights; industrial relations; and apprenticeship training and employment. Some of the branches that have existed within the Department include the Boiler Inspection Branch, the Elevator Inspection Branch, the Factory Inspection Branch, the Construction Safety Branch, the Engineering Services Branch, the Fair Employment Practices Branch, the Industrial Training Branch, the Labour Standards Branch, the Public Relations and Information Branch, and a wide variety of departmental administrative services branches. Agencies which reported to the Department include the Ontario Human Rights Commission; the Industry and Labour Board, the Ontario Labour Relations Board, the Board of Examiners of Operating Engineers, and the Workmen's Compensation Board. In 1972 the Ontario government was substantially reorganized and many former departments were disbanded and replaced with Ministries. The Department of Labour continued to exist as the Ministry of Labour, but lost several of its functions to other jurisdictions during the restructuring. Of particular note were a number of functions associated with the regulation of working conditions and the safety of workers, which were transferred to the newly-formed Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations (MCCR). In addition, the Industrial Training Branch was transferred to the Ministry of Colleges and Universities.";

  rico:history "On January 23, 1869, an Act was passed establishing the Department of Public Works for Ontario. The Act also established that the Department was to be presided over by the Commissioner of Agriculture and Public Works. This Commissioner, although responsible for both agriculture and public works, was referred to simply as the Commissioner of Public Works when dealing with matters related to public works. This situation was formally changed in 1874, when legislation was passed establishing a separate commissioner to be responsible for the Department of Public Works. In 1900, both the Office of the Commissioner of Highways and the Bureau of Labour were established as part of the Department of Public Works. In 1914, the Office of the Commissioner of Highways (by then renamed the Highways Branch), was elevated to Department status, becoming the Department of Public Highways. Similarly, by 1919, the Bureau of Labour had become the Department of Labour. Also in 1900, the Colonization Roads Branch was transferred to the Department of Public Works. Formerly with the Department of Crown Lands and responsible for constructing and repairing roads in sparsely settled areas of the province, this Branch was transferred to the Department of Lands, Forests and Mines in 1919. The Department of Public Works continued to exist until 1972, when its programs and functions were taken over by the newly created Ministry of Government Services.";

In addition to the Trade and Industry Division, the Department consisted of an Information Services Branch, the Selective Immigration Service (renamed from the Immigration Branch in 1969), the Special Projects and Planning Division, and a Finance and Administration Division. The department also contained a variety of other agencies which promoted Ontario's economic development. Among these were the Ontario Research Foundation, the Ontario Development Corporation and the Ontario Housing Corporation. Ministers for this Department were Stanley J. Randall (1968 1970) and Allan Grossman (1971-1972). The Department of Trade and Development merged with the Department of Tourism and Information in April 1972 to form the Ministry of Industry and Tourism.";

Although these formally were part of the Department, it represented more of an administrative convenience than an alteration of the function of the Provincial Secretary's Department. Other offices and agencies attached to the Department were the Registrar General's Office, the Office of the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly, the Recording Office, the Marriage Office, the Legislative Library, the Queen's Printer, the Community Development Branch and the Indian Community Branch. On April 1, 1972 the government of Ontario was altered profoundly as new Ministries were created replacing all existing Departments.

Members of the Executive Council are selected from the Legislative Assembly, and generally serve as political heads of government Ministries. Under the terms of the British North America Act of 1867, the Executive Council consisted of only five executive officers. These were the Attorney General, the Secretary and Registrar, the Treasurer, the Commissioner of Crown Lands and the Commissioner of Agriculture and Public Works. Since then, however, the Executive Council has expanded as the number of Departments/Ministries within the Government has increased. In addition, legislation passed in 1910 also allowed for the inclusion of Ministers without Portfolios within the Executive Council. The Cabinet is supported in its policy development and analysis role by the Cabinet Office, the central agency of the Cabinet, and by various Cabinet committees - both standing committees and ad hoc committees. The two primary standing committees of the Cabinet are the Management Board of Cabinet (known as the Treasury Board prior to 1971) and the Policy and Priorities Board of Cabinet (established in 1971). The Executive Council is responsible to the Legislative Assembly for its actions and must resign if it cannot maintain majority support in that body.";

With this change, the Board was given additional responsibility for the management of the public service. The Management Board consists of a Chairman (usually a Cabinet Minister), a Vice-Chairman, and between four and six other members of the Executive Council. From 1971 to 2005, the Board was supported by the Management Board Secretariat. The Secretariat was abolished in 2005 and most of its functions transferred to the new Ministry of Government services; the Deputy Minister of Government Services also served as Secretary to the Management Board. The Secretariat was also assisted by the Civil Service Commission of Ontario. In 1991, the financial management functions of the Management Board of Cabinet and its Secretariat were transferred to a new Treasury Board, which was established within the Ministry of Treasury and Economics. In 1995, however, the Treasury Board was dissolved and these functions once again became the responsibility of the Management Board and the Management Board Secretariat. These functions were transferred to the Ministry of Finance in 2005. In 2014, the Management Board along with the Treasury Board became a joint sub-committee of cabinet as a result of the re-establishment of the Treasury Board and Treasury Board Secretariat.";

Responsibility for probation services was transferred to the Ministry of Correctional Services from the Ministry of the Attorney General in 1972. In 1977, the Children's Services Division was transferred to the Ministry of Community and Social Services. And, in 1984, with the passage of the federal Young Offenders Act, the Ministry assumed responsibility for detention and parole of young offenders aged 16 and 17. Other divisions and branches which formed a part of the Ministry included the Operations Division (known as the Institutions Division until 1986), the Community Programs Division (reduced to branch status as part of the Operations Division in 1986), and the Corporate Services Division (established in 1987). In February 1993, the Ministry merged with the Ministry of the Solicitor General to form the Ministry of the Solicitor General and Correctional Services.";

  rico:history "The Ministry of Financial Institutions was established on April 1, 1986, from the Financial Institutions Division of the Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations. The structure of the new Ministry was such that the Superintendent of Insurance and the Superintendent of Deposit Institutions were in charge of the primary functions of the Ministry, while a number of administrative support branches existed which reported to the Deputy Minister. The Pension Commission of Ontario and the Ontario Securities Commission reported separately to the Deputy Minister, as did the Ontario Automobile Insurance Board during its brief existence. Two significant administrative changes occurred within the Ministry of Financial Institutions between 1986 and 1993. The first occurred when the Ontario Insurance Commission was formed on May 29, 1990. The Commission assumed the responsibilities formerly held by the Superintendent of Insurance (and those branches reporting to the Superintendent) and the Ontario Automobile Insurance Board, although its responsibilities were expanded somewhat beyond those held by both predecessor bodies. The second was the formation of the Ontario Automobile Insurance Review (AIR), which was announced by the Premier of Ontario in the 1990 Throne Speech. The review was responsible for developing a comprehensive reform of the automobile insurance system in Ontario, and establishing a corporation to implement and run a government funded insurance system. Essentially, the Review was a division of the Ministry, headed by a Deputy Minister. Within the division, two branches existed: a Corporate Services Branch and a Policy and Support Branch. The Ministry of Financial Institutions was disbanded in February, 1993 when the Ministry of Finance replaced the former Ministries of Financial Institutions, Treasury and Economics, and Revenue.";

These are municipal affairs, international relations, federal- provincial relations, Ontario-Quebec relations, and administrative and corporate services. In 1981, the municipal affairs functions of the Ministry were removed and amalgamated with the Ministry of Housing to form the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing. In 1991, the International Relations Branch was transferred to the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Technology. Also, the Office of Federal-Provincial Relations was renamed the Office of Constitutional Affairs and Federal-Provincial Relations, reflecting an increase in the importance of the Office's responsibilities to provide advice to the Government of Ontario on constitutional matters.";

Until 1989, the branches of the Ministry were essentially grouped into two primary divisions - Municipal Affairs and Community Planning. In 1989, however, the Ministry was restructured and the divisions were reformed as the Municipal Policy Development Division and the Municipal Operations Division. The administrative services of the Ministry were carried out by a Corporate Resources Management Division, which was jointly responsible for the human resources, financial and accounting, facilities, and communications services of both the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and the Ministry of Housing. Agencies which reported to the Ministry included the Ontario Municipal Board, the Ontario Municipal Audit Bureau, and the Niagara Escarpment Commission. The Ministry of Municipal Affairs continued to exist until 1995, when it was re-amalgamated with the Ministry of Housing (1985-1995) to form the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing (1995- ).";

Although the names of these divisions have at times changed, they have tended to focus around several primary areas: water and land conservation and management; fish and wildlife management; field services and regional office administration; forest resources; and provincial parks and recreation areas. The Ministry was responsible for programs and activities concerning northern affairs, until 1977, and for mines, until 1985. The northern affairs functions was removed from the Ministry in 1977 and established as the Ministry of Northern Affairs. In 1985, the mines functions were transferred to the Ministry of Northern Affairs, which was subsequently renamed the Ministry of Northern Affairs and Mines. Agencies of the Ministry have included: the Niagara Parks Commission; the St. Lawrence Parks Commission; the Mining and Lands Commissioner; the Algonquin Forestry Authority; and the Provincial Parks Council, among others. In 2014 the ministry was renamed the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, but responsibilities did not change.";

These were the Office of the Deputy Minister, the Tax Revenue and Grants Program, the Property Assessment Program, and the Support Services Division. Also attached to the Ministry was the Province of Ontario Savings Office. The Tax Revenue and Grants Program was administered by an Assistant Deputy Minister and was responsible for retail sales tax, motor fuels and tobacco tax, corporations tax, tax appeals, and for the Tax Operations and Design Division (renamed the Revenue Services and Operations Division in 1991). The Property Assessment Program, also administered by an Assistant Deputy Minister, consisted of the Assessment Services Division, the Assessment Policies and Priorities Branch, and the various Property Assessment Regional Offices. In 1986, the Support Services Division was renamed the Corporate Resources Division, and in 1988, an Information Technology Division was established. In 1993, the Ministry was amalgamated with the Ministry of Financial Institutions and the Ministry of Treasury and Economics to form the Ministry of Finance.";

In 1991, a new Treasury Board (the old Treasury Board, established in 1886, having been replaced with the Management Board of Cabinet in 1971) was established within the Ministry of Treasury and Economics. This Board assumed responsibility over the financial management of the provincial government, previously a function of the Management Board of Cabinet. Agencies which reported to the Ministry included the Ontario Economic Council, the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board, the Ontario Municipal Improvement Corporation, the Stadium Corporation of Ontario, Ltd., the Teacher's Superannuation Commission, the Inflation Restraint Board, the Ontario Universities Capital Aid Corporation, and the Ontario Education Capital Aid Corporation. In 1993, the Ministry of Treasury and Economics was amalgamated with the Ministry of Revenue and the Ministry of Financial Institutions to form the Ministry of Finance.";

  rico:history "The Ministry of the Environment was established in 1972, with the merging of the Department of the Environment with the Ontario Water Resources Commission. Although the administrative structure of the Ministry changed often during its existence, certain core functions remained constant, including water and air quality management, environmental assessment and laboratory services. As government involvement in environmental monitoring and control expanded, new or more specialized areas of concern, such as hazardous contaminants, emerged as areas of sufficient importance to deserve their own branches. A number of boards, agencies and commissions grew up around the Ministry in response to legislation and the need for community and technical input to Ministry decisions. These included the Environmental Assessment Board, the Environmental Appeal Board, the Pesticides Advisory Committee, and the Ontario Waste Management Corporation. In 1993, the Ministry of the Environment was amalgamated with the Ministry of Energy to form the Ministry of the Environment and Energy.";

The various jails, detention centres, treatment centres and young offenders facilities in Ontario are administered by the Ministry through the Correctional Services Division. Agencies which reported to the Ministry include the Animal Care Review Board, the Coroners Council, the Fire Code Commission, the Ontario Board of Parole, the Ontario Civilian Commission on Police Services, and the Ontario Police Arbitration Commission.

  rico:history "The Provincial Secretariat for Justice was established in 1972 as part of a general administrative reorganization of the Government of Ontario. With this reorganisation, the Ministries of the Government, with a few exceptions, were grouped into three common areas of interest called policy fields. The three policy fields established were the Justice Policy Field, the Social Development Policy Field and the Resources Development Policy Field. Cabinet Committees were established for each field, to be chaired by a Provincial Secretary given Cabinet Minister status, and to be responsible for co-ordinating and developing policies for the various Ministries which formed that policy field. In addition, Secretariats were established for each field in order to provide analytical and research support to the Provincial Secretaries and the Cabinet Committees. As such, the Provincial Secretariat for Justice provided support services to the Cabinet Committee on Justice, which was responsible for the development of policies for the Ministry of the Attorney General, the Ministry of the Solicitor General, the Ministry of Correctional Services, and the Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations. The Secretariat enjoyed considerable influence over the formulation of government policy during the years 1972-1974, but saw its influence erode as the  Ministries reasserted their control over policy development. The Secretariat was disbanded by Premier Frank Miller in 1985.";

  rico:history "The Provincial Secretariat for Resources Development was established in 1972 as part of a general administrative reorganization of the Government of Ontario. With this reorganization, Ministries, with a few exceptions, were grouped into three common areas of interest called \"policy fields\". The three policy fields established were the Justice Policy Field, the Social Development Policy Field and the Resources Development Policy Field. Cabinet Committees were established for each field, to be chaired by a Provincial Secretary given Cabinet Minister status, and to be responsible for co-ordinating and developing policies for the various Ministries which formed that policy field. In addition, Secretariats were established for each field to provide analytical and research support to the Provincial Secretaries and the Cabinet Committees. As such, the Provincial Secretariat for Resources Development provided support services to the Cabinet Committee on Resources Development, which was responsible for co- ordinating and developing policies for the Ministries of Agriculture and Food, Natural Resources, Environment, Energy, Industry and Tourism, Culture and Recreation, Municipal Affairs and Housing, Labour, and Transportation and Communications. In addition, the Secretariat provided support to the Cabinet Committee on Native Affairs, which was also chaired by the Provincial Secretary of Resources Development. In 1975, the Niagara Escarpment Commission was transferred to the Provincial Secretariat for Resources Development from the Ministry of Treasury, Economics and Intergovernmental Affairs. The Secretariat enjoyed considerable influence over the formulation of government policy during the years 1972-1974, but saw its influence erode as the Ministries reasserted their control over policy development. The Secretariat was disbanded by Premier Frank Miller in 1985.";

  rico:history "The Treasury Board was originally established in 1886 as a Committee of the Executive Council. The provincial Treasurer served as the chair of the committee. During the period prior to 1950, the Board had little power, met infrequently and had no permanent staff. Its primary role during this period was to review and approve Special Warrants and Treasury Board Orders to meet shortfalls in departmental estimates. The development of the government in the wake of the depression and war, however, quickly overwhelmed the ability of the existing system to deal with demands on government revenues. A private firm of auditors, Woods, Gordon and Company, recommended a complete revision of the act and the functions of the Treasury Board to deal with the new situation. This revision took the form of the \"Financial Administration Act\" of 1954, which stipulated that the Board would consist of the Treasurer as Chair, along with four to seven members of the Executive Council, and that this body would serve as the Committee of the Executive Council on all matters relating to finance, revenues, estimates, expenditures and any other matter concerning general administrative policy of the Government of Ontario. The Board was also given the power to call witnesses and compel the production of documents from the public service relating to financial administration and to make regulations relating to the administration of public money and the efficient administration of the public service. In 1962, a permanent Treasury Board Secretariat was established in order to provide advice and analysis to the Treasury Board on government programs and expenditures. In 1971, the Treasury Board was renamed the Management Board of Cabinet with expanded responsibilities for personnel management.";

  rico:history "Although the structure and responsibilities of the Executive Council were not defined by the Constitutional Act of 1791, it was understood that such a body would exist as part of the English governmental system being established in the new Province of Upper Canada. Members of the Executive Council were generally appointed by the Crown - on the recommendation of the Lieutenant Governor - or by the Lieutenant Governor himself. Most were also members of the Legislative Council (of the thirty-six appointments to the Executive Council between 1791 and 1841, twenty-four were members of the Legislative Council). However, being a member of the Legislative Council was not a pre-requisite for appointment. The Executive Council of Upper Canada was not responsible to the Legislative Assembly (unlike the current Executive Council of the Province of Ontario), rather it was simply an advisory body to the Lieutenant Governor. In the absence of the Lieutenant Governor, the administrator of the province was chosen from among the senior members of the Council. Three members of the Council together constituted a quorum. With the union of Upper and Lower Canada in 1841, the Executive Council of Upper Canada was dissolved, and replaced by the Executive Council of the Province of Canada.";
